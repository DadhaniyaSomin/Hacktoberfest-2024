- ## Q1. Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.

- You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

- You can return the answer in any order.

- Example 1:

- Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
- Output: [0,1]
- Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

- ## Q2. Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

- Example 1:
- Input: s = "abcabcbb"
- Output: 3
- Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

- ## Q3. Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].

- The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

- You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

- Example 1:

- Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
- Output: [24,12,8,6]

- ## Q4. Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is in the range [1, n] inclusive.

- There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.

- You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and using only constant extra space.

- Example 1:
- Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
- Output: 2
