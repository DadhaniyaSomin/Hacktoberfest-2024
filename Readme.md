## Ready to Dive In? 🚀

1. **Find an issue** that interests you and ask the project maintainers to assign it to you.  
2. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub.  
3. Clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/wmt-mobile/Hacktoberfest-2024.git"
   ```
4. Create a new branch for the issue you're working on:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b issue/branch-name
   ```
5. **Add yourself** to the CONTRIBUTORS.md file using the format below:
   ```
   Name: [YOUR NAME](Github Profile Link)  
   Place: Your city  
   About: Short Introduction  
   Programming Language: Which programming languages do you know?  
   Email: Your email  
   ```
6. **Commit and push** your changes to your fork:
   ```bash
   git add .  
   git commit -m "Add YOUR NAME to contributors list"  
   git push origin issue/branch-name  
   ```
7. Head back to GitHub and **submit a pull request (PR)** with a brief description of your awesome work!  
8. Now, just chill and wait for your PR to be reviewed and merged. 🍹
