[Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com) is an awesome month-long celebration of open-source, brought to you by DigitalOcean, GitHub, and other great sponsors! It’s all about giving back to the community, contributing to projects you care about, and maybe even learning something new along the way. Whether you're an open-source pro or a first-timer, **everyone’s welcome** to join! 🌍

*Why should you participate?*  
- **Learn:** Gain hands-on experience with version control, code reviews, and project management.
- **Network:** Meet other like-minded developers and grow your professional network.
- **Swag:** Complete 4 PRs and earn **exclusive Holopin badges** 🛡️ to show off your open-source contributions!
- **Impact:** Your contributions help make the open-source ecosystem better for everyone!

## Ready to Dive In? 🚀

1. **Find an issue** that is assigned to you, or ask the project maintainers to assign it if not.
2. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub.
3. Clone it to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone "https://github.com/wmt-mobile/Hacktoberfest-2024.git"
   ```
4. Create a new branch for the issue you're working on:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b issue/branch-name
   ```
5. Resolve each question and create a separate folder for each one. **Make sure to submit each question as a separate PR** to ensure they are merged individually.
6. After all your PRs have been merged, **add yourself** to the CONTRIBUTORS.md file using the format below:
   ```
   Name: [YOUR NAME](Github Profile Link)  
   Place: Your city  
   About: Short Introduction  
   Programming Language: Which programming languages do you know?  
   Email: Your email  
   ```
7. **Commit and push** the CONTRIBUTORS.md changes:
   ```bash
   git add CONTRIBUTORS.md  
   git commit -m "Add YOUR NAME to contributors list"  
   git push origin issue/branch-name  
   ```
8. Head back to GitHub and **submit a final PR** to update the CONTRIBUTORS.md with your details.
9. Now, just relax and wait for your final PR to be reviewed and merged. 🎉

💡 **Pro Tip:** You can contribute to as many projects as you want, but only PRs to repositories tagged `hacktoberfest-accepted` or those that have the `hacktoberfest` topic count towards the 4-Pull Request goal.
