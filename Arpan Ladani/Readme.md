## Q.Implement a Simple Linear Regression:
- Task: Write a function in Python that implements simple linear regression using
gradient descent. The function should take in training data (X, y) and return the
learned parameters (slope and intercept).
- Example Input: X = [1, 2, 3, 4], y = [2, 3, 4, 5]
- Output: (slope, intercept)

## Q.Implement a Decision Tree Classifier:
- Task: Write a function to create a decision tree classifier from scratch. The function
should take in features and labels and return predictions for a given test set.
- Example Input:
``` X_train = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 1], [6, 5]],
 y_train = [0, 0, 1, 1],
 X_test = [[1, 1], [7, 5]] 
 ```
- Output: Predictions for X_test.

## Q.Implement a Matrix Multiplication:
- Task: Write a function to perform matrix multiplication for two 2D lists (matrices) without using any built-in libraries.
- Example Input: A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]], B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
- Output: The resulting matrix.
